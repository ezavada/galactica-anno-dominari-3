Since this may depend upon the amount of memory allocated by the user	as well as the number of local (non-networked) games currently running, there is no 	clean way for the server process to know when it should prohibit new games.  The cleanest 	way is for you to explicitly tell it to do so.  In a game like SimpleCards (Cribbage also)	which is not yet capable of controlling multiple concurrent games, you can call	GS_DisableNewGames() at the beginning of each game.	When your application is once again capable of handling a new game, call the opposite	function, GS_EnableNewGames().*/void 		GS_DisableNewGames();void 		GS_EnableNewGames();/*  Note:  In SimpleCards, I do not disable new games when a local game is started.  Instead,	I allow new connections, and if a local game is running when GS_IsServerEvent() reports 	that a new game connection has been made, I blow away the local game and start the net game.	This is a good thing to do, since it was obviously the user's preference to play on the	net.
