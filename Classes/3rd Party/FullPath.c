Full pathnames are	particularly unreliable as a means of identifying files, directories	or volumes within your application, for two primary reasons:		* 	The user can change the name of any element in the path at virtually		any time.	*	Volume names on the Macintosh are *not* unique. Multiple		mounted volumes can have the same name. For this reason, the use of		a full pathname to identify a specific volume may not produce the		results you expect. If more than one volume has the same name and		a full pathname is used, the File Manager currently uses the first		mounted volume it finds with a matching name in the volume queue.		In general, you should use a fileÕs name, parent directory ID, and	volume reference number to identify a file you want to open, delete,	or otherwise manipulate.		If you need to remember the location of a particular file across	subsequent system boots, use the Alias Manager to create an alias record	describing the file. If the Alias Manager is not available, you can save	the fileÕs name, its parent directory ID, and the name of the volume on	which itÕs located. Although none of these methods is foolproof, they are	much more reliable than using full pathnames to identify files.		Nonetheless, it is sometimes useful to display a fileÕs full pathname to	the user. For example, a backup utility might display a list of full	pathnames of files as it copies them onto the backup medium. Or, a	utility might want to display a dialog box showing the full pathname of	a file when it needs the userÕs confirmation to delete the file. No	matter how unreliable full pathnames may be from a file-specification	viewpoint, users understand them more readily than volume reference	numbers or directory IDs. (Hint: Use the TruncString function from	TextUtils.h with truncMiddle as the truncWhere argument to shorten	full pathnames to a displayable length.)		The following technique for constructing the full pathname of a file is	intended for display purposes only. Applications that depend on any	particular structure of a full pathname are likely to fail on alternate	foreign file systems or under future system software versions.*//*****************************************************************************/OSErr FSpGetNativeFullPath(const FSSpec* spec, char* outFullPath, long bufferSize){    // start by getting posix path    OSErr err = FSpGetPosixFullPath(spec, outFullPath, bufferSize);    // need to convert from Posix to Native    if (outFullPath[0] == '/') {        // full path, must remove leading slash        memcpy(outFullPath, &outFullPath[1], bufferSize);    } else {        // relative path, must start with colon        memcpy(&outFullPath[1], outFullPath, bufferSize-1);        outFullPath[0] = ':';    }    char * p;    p = strchr(outFullPath, '/');     while (p) {        *p = ':';        p = strchr(p+1, '/');    }        return err;}/*****************************************************************************/OSErr FSpGetPosixFullPath(const FSSpec* spec, char* outFullPath, long bufferSize){	OSErr		result;	OSErr		realResult;	CInfoPBRec	pb;		char tmpStr[256];   // for pascal to C string conversions.	char* workBuffer = (char*) malloc(bufferSize);	if (workBuffer == NULL) 	{	    return memFullErr;	}	/* Default to noErr */	realResult = result = noErr;		if ( spec->parID == fsRtParID )	{		/* The object is a volume */				p2cstrcpy(tmpStr, spec->name);    #ifdef __MACH__		snprintf(outFullPath, bufferSize, "/Volumes/%s/", tmpStr);    #else		snprintf(outFullPath, bufferSize, "/%s/", tmpStr);    #endif ! __MACH__		outFullPath[bufferSize-1] = 0;	}	else	{		/* The object isn't a volume */		Str255 s;		memcpy(s, spec->name, spec->name[0]+1);				/* Is the object a file or a directory? */		pb.dirInfo.ioNamePtr = s;		pb.dirInfo.ioVRefNum = spec->vRefNum;		pb.dirInfo.ioDrDirID = spec->parID;		pb.dirInfo.ioFDirIndex = 0;		result = PBGetCatInfoSync(&pb);		// Allow file/directory name at end of path to not exist.		realResult = result;		if ( (result == noErr) || (result == fnfErr) )		{    		p2cstrcpy(tmpStr, s);			/* if the object is a directory, append a slash so full pathname ends with slash */			if ( (result == noErr) && (pb.hFileInfo.ioFlAttrib & kioFlAttribDirMask) != 0 )			{    		    snprintf(outFullPath, bufferSize, "%s/", tmpStr);			} 			else 			{    		    snprintf(outFullPath, bufferSize, "%s", tmpStr);			}    		outFullPath[bufferSize-1] = 0;    		    		// clear file not found so we can get the path		    if (result == fnfErr) {		        result = noErr;		    }						if ( result == noErr )			{				/* Get the ancestor directory names */				pb.dirInfo.ioNamePtr = (StringPtr)s;				pb.dirInfo.ioVRefNum = spec->vRefNum;				pb.dirInfo.ioDrParID = spec->parID;				do	/* loop until we have an error or find the root directory */				{					pb.dirInfo.ioFDirIndex = -1;					pb.dirInfo.ioDrDirID = pb.dirInfo.ioDrParID;					result = PBGetCatInfoSync(&pb);					if ( result == noErr )					{						/* Preprend next level up directory name */					    strncpy(workBuffer, outFullPath, bufferSize);    		            p2cstrcpy(tmpStr, s);    		            if (pb.dirInfo.ioDrDirID == fsRtDirID)     		            {    		                /* root directory, prefix with slash to indicate root path */                        #ifdef __MACH__                            /* if we are building for MACH-O, it's because we are on Mac OS X using some                               Carbon APIs.
