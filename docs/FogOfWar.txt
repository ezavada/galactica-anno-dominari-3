DONE - Courier arrival with new tech needs to update scan range
DONE - Don't draw fleets (or other stuff?) parked at stars
DONE - Consider: Make only planets and couriers have scanners
DONE - Consider: much smaller apparent size for planets
DONE - Consider: simplify scan range and stealth
DONE - Consider: Scan range grows roughly as is, all ships have same apparent size,
            couriers have stealth 4, everything else is stealth 1
            vis 1 is inside lowest circle, vis 2 inside 2nd, vis 3 inside 3rd
            (courier vis 1 inside 3rd circle)
DONE - Consider: Smaller change to scan range with tech level increase
DONE - Consider: Don't get events about things you can't see, except battles
REJECTED - Consider: Picking up new tech for couriers should improve scan range?
DONE - Test and fix multiplayer
- WriteChangesToHost? mod in Code section below, only send visible things to client
DONE - Consider: Can't see who owns stars unless in range
DONE - Consider: Reduce scan range growth rate to 1/2 current rate
DONE - Consider: art for unknown ship type instead of using courier
DONE - Consider: don't show scout circles for couriers on course loop
DONE - Consider: make looping courses different color (purple)
DONE - Consider: only show innermost circle for couriers unless selected
FIXED - Bug: ship ? showing up at planets when targeting even when they shouldn't be visible
FIXED - BUG: course waypoints reveal ownership of stars
FIXED - BUG: owned stars with no visibility brighter than unowned stars
FIXED - BUG: Nico having crashes
FIXED - BUG: can't handle game names with XML illegal chars.
FIXED - Bug: something attacked S-180-16, courier at same was made into fleet 858 at (0.69,9.30) pos of star (turn 34)
FIXED - Bug: turn 34, didn't see event for Red Attack 560 fleet destroying enemy fleet

- BUG: crash in ThingyIsValid__FPC15AGalacticThingy + 0x3c, Aug 20 20:48:53
- Bug: if unowned planet has one of your ships at it, show ships at planet, otherwise ship "lost"
- Bug: when selecting course segments of courier, range color toggles between purple-white and green
(following see file FOWTest_050818_1740.out)
- Bug: turn 54 (or before), fleet 967 at S-114-13b, but not in ships at star list
- Consider: see ships in fleets for fleets you can fully see
- Consider: add back in option to turn off fog of war
WAIT - Consider: courier's don't do combat when arriving at enemy system
WAIT - Consider: courier on patrol in enemy system can see planet details
WAIT - Consider: if tech level of system 1.5x tech level of courier, courier on patrol in system becomes visible

No information about an item is sent from host unless it is in scan
range of the player it is being sent to.

Stars are always visible on map.

Items have a size, which represents their visibility. A size 2 object is
visible at 2x distance that a size 1 object is, all else being equal.

Stealth = (tech level * 0.75) + 1

Items have a scan range, which represents their ability to detect other
objects. Formula is (TechLevel + 1) * 6000, *2 if Fast Game

Formula is:
base_visiblility = (viewer.scanrange * target.size)/(dist*target.stealth))
if (base_visiblility >= 25) 
	ships can be seen, velocity measured
	planets at stars can be seen
	visibility = 1 (speed)
if (base_visiblility >= 35)
	ships' owner can be determined
	planets' owner can be determined
	visibility = 2 (owner, based on engine particle output signature)
if (base_visiblility >= 75)
	ships' tech level and class can be determined
	planets' tech level can be determined
	visibility = 3 (tech level, class, based on size, etc...)
if (base_visiblility(tech level 1 object of size being constructed at planet) > 75)
	planet's production can be seen.
	visibility = 4 (production type)

Summary:

In this summary, Turns Distance is the number of turns it takes for a battleship of \
the given class to travel between the two places.

Battleships stay roughly spotable at the same distances, because their increased size
at higher levels is offset by better stealth technology. Planet with defense satellites 
can spot enemy battleships of same level 3 turns away, can identify who they belong two 
at 2 turns away, and can tell their class and power by 1 turn away.

Defense satellites are increasing hard to spot as tech levels increase, due to the
ever improving stealth technology incorporated, and because they don't really increase
much in size. So at higher tech levels you have to be much closer to tell how well
defended a planet is by satellites. For example, at 1st level, you can tell class and
power of defense satellites at a planet by that is within two turns distance. But at
10th level you can just barely spot them at 2 turns distance. Of course, at 10th level
2 turns distance is 3x further away in terms of absolute distance.

Colony ships are always easy to see because they are so big. However, they don't grow
in size with tech level nearly as much as a battleship does, so they do get harder to
see as the tech level (and thus level of stealth technology) increases. Examples:
A level 1 colony ship is visible at 86 turns distance, detail scan at 29 turns distance
A level 5 colony ship is visible at 37 turns distance, detail scan at 12 turns distance
A level 20 colony ship is visible at 15 turns distance, detail scan at 5 turns distance

Scout ships are really hard to spot, because they are very small and make maximum use 
of stealth technology. Basically you have to be one just under one turns distance to spot
a level 5 scout ship, but less than a 3rd of a turn's distance to spot a level 20 scout.
This means in terms of absolute distance you have to be about 20% closer to spot the level
20 scout than the level 5 scout, even when your scanner technology is at the same level
as the scout's stealth technology.


Res:
Planets with defense satellites have best scan resolution
Colony ships have 80% of defended planet's res
Scout ships have 60% of defended planet's res
Planet with no defense satellites has 50% defended planet's res
Battleship has 10% defended planet's res

Size:
Star systems are always visible
Planets have size of 5 million meters
Scout ships have size of 50 meters - (0.25 * level), min size 1 meter
Defense satellites have size of 200 meters + 5 * level
Battleships have size of 100 meters + 100 * class
Colony ships have size of 2000 meters + 20 * level

Player comparision should only show known/estimated information, can't calculate from
real values.

---------
UI
---------

- click on an object makes it's scanner range circles be drawn

- ideal: way to see entire scan area of all items you own

- Contact event, for things that just entered range

- Lost contact event, for things that just left range, est position visible (for ? turns)

- est positions are generated by client based on last known pos and velocity, not 
  tracked by game engine

---------
AI
---------

- Must ignore any items it doesn't know about

- Must continue to react to any items it knew about but has lost sight of


---------
Code
---------

- Add methods to AGalacticThingy to get and set scannerRange, scannerRes, size and stealth
- Add methods to AGalacticThingy to get and set min/maxVisibility, for special items
- Add array to AGalacticThingy which holds visibility of item to each player, and when
  last seen
- Add code to GalacticaProcessor::FinishEndOfTurn to calc visibility of items for 
  each player. Items that were visible last turn but not this will generate a lost
  contact event, items that were not visible last turn but are this turn will generate
  a contact event, with the new flag if this item was never seen before. 
  NOTES: have presorted list of player's stuff by scanner range * tech level, single 
    pass starting with highest items first. Could be further optimized by using 
    subsectors if that is done, will complicated code though. Might have to track 
    highest tech * range item for a sector, or better yet do grid calculation to find
    grid squares that are entirely within scan range of a particular player, thus
    reducing number of items that need to be checked
- Add method AGalacticThingy::getVisiblityTo(playerNum), which gets visibility from
	array for given player
- Add method AGalacticThingy::isVisibleTo(playerNum), which returns true if items is
	visible by anything the player owns
- Add code to Host::WriteChangesToHost() to check on per-player basis whether thing
	is visible before sending to player, and if visible, to only send information they
	can see
- Change client CbxInPanel, CbxNaPanel, and CbxShPanel to only show info known about an
	enemy ship, and replace the rest with question marks, or not draw it at all
- Add code to AI to ignore any items not visible to it
- Add code to track last known target of item for AIs to use to extrapolate
- Update player comparision window to account for unknown data
